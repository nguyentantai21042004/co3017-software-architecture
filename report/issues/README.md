# Issues Directory

This directory contains gap analysis and issue tracking files for the Software Architecture report completion project.

## Purpose

Track all gaps, discrepancies, and questions identified during the analysis phase. Each file documents specific issues for a report section or verification activity.

## File Structure

- `requirements-gaps.md` - Gaps in Chapter 2 (Requirements Analysis)
- `architecture-design-gaps.md` - Gaps in Chapter 3 (Architecture Design)
- `architecture-views-gaps.md` - Gaps in Chapter 4 (Architecture Views)
- `solid-gaps.md` - Gaps in Chapter 5 (SOLID Principles)
- `implementation-gaps.md` - Gaps in Chapter 6 (System Implementation)
- `reflection-gaps.md` - Gaps in Reflection & Evaluation section
- `user-questions.md` - Consolidated questions requiring user input
- `quick-wins.md` - High-impact, low-effort tasks
- `erd-verification.md` - ERD vs database schema verification results
- `sequence-verification.md` - Sequence diagram verification results
- `adr-verification.md` - ADR implementation verification results
- `solid-verification.md` - SOLID code example verification results
- `verification-summary.md` - Overall verification statistics
- `rubric-validation.md` - Final score validation against rubric

## Usage

1. **Analysis Phase:** Create gap files documenting missing content
2. **Verification Phase:** Create verification files documenting discrepancies
3. **Resolution:** Update files as issues are resolved
4. **Tracking:** Use [RESOLVED], [PENDING], [USER_INPUT] tags to track status
