# Proposal: Refactor and Stabilize Microservices

This proposal outlines a comprehensive effort to review, refactor, and stabilize the entire suite of microservices within the `sources/` directory. The goal is to improve code quality, increase test coverage, fix bugs, and ensure the overall system behaves correctly and reliably.

The project will be broken down by service, addressing each one's stability before ensuring integration between them works as expected.
